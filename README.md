# arduino-incubator

This is my first arduino program. Over the summer I was experimenting with fermented foods like yogurt and cooking methods like sous vide, both of which require temperature control. This was made in conjunction with the following:

* Arduino Uno
* DS18B20 digital temperature sensor
* [LCD keypad shield](http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php?title=Arduino_LCD_KeyPad_Shield_%28SKU:_DFR0009%29)
* A relay suitable for handling a crock pot or rice cooker

This does not use any PID algorithms unfortunately. Maybe in the future though. I was able to keep the temperature within a couple of degrees though! Quick info on use:

* Up/Down keys increase temperature by ½° F
* Right/Left keys increase/decrease temperature by 10° F
* Short hold of Select key toggles LCD (with backlight) on/off

[Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/crBag) of an early prototype when I used it with kombucha. 

Feel free to contact me if anyone out there happens to see this and has questions.
